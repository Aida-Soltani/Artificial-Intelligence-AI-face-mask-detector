# Face-detection-with-deep-learning-CNN-
ProjectPhase1.py
Using pytorch library to apply face detection by deep Learning (CNN). we detect the face of people with/without mask. In order to make our model stronger we've used the animal images such as cat, dog,
and specially monkey which is really look like human being.
